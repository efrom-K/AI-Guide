"""Reverse geocoding: GPS point -> Address(country, city, district, street).

This is what lets the guide narrate "от общего к частному" — it has to know the
city / district / street it is standing in before it can descend to the objects
inside them. Public Nominatim is often blocked/limited, so the default provider
reuses the same reachable Overpass endpoint as place discovery: ``is_in`` returns
the administrative areas enclosing the point, and a small ``around`` query finds
the street. Off the hot-path and move-gated by the orchestrator (areas change
slowly), so the extra request is rare.
