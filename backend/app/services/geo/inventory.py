"""Per-session object inventory: fetch a wide disc of places ONCE and reuse it on
every tick, so Overpass leaves the narration hot-path.

Why this exists: a single Overpass query per tick is slow (1.5-8 s) and a single
point of failure — when the endpoint stalled, the whole guide went silent (the
"вообще всё пропало" outage). By caching a ~800 m disc per session and re-fetching
only when the user walks past half its radius, almost every tick is served from
memory; ranking against the live position is microseconds.

It also remembers each object's distance over time (closest-approach), so the
guide can tell "coming up" from "already walked past" and prefer what's ahead.

The store lives on the Discovery instance (one per orchestrator / per process), so
it survives WebSocket reconnects like the resume design wants, while staying
isolated between tests (each test builds its own orchestrator).
